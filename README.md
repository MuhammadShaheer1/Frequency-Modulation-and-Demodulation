# Frequency-Modulation-and-Demodulation

## Objectives

The primary objectives of our project are to: 

- Generate a Message and a Carrier Signal and then implement frequency modulation.
- Demodulate the FM signal using frequency discriminator method.
- Perform the simulation of the project on software and implement it on hardware.


## Introduction

In order to send analog signal (e.g., sound, video, image) over long distances, first the signal have to be modulated. Modulation is the process of varying one or more properties of a high frequency signal also called carrier according to message or modulating signal. Modulation has different types:

1.Amplitude Modulation
2.Angle Modulation
3.Pulse Modulation
4.Spread Spectrum

The angle modulation is further divided in two types:

- Frequency Modulation
- Phase Modulation

## Applications

Frequency modulation is widely used in:
> FM radio broadcasting
> Telemetry
> Radar
> Seismic prospecting and monitoring newborns for seizures via EEG
> Two-way radio systems
> Sound synthesis
> Magnetic tape-recording systems
 And some video-transmission systems.


## Conclusion

In this project, we frequency modulated a message signal and then demodulated it using simple slope detector. The simple slope detector is a differentiator along with an envelope detector. Its output is highly non-linear, and it has distortion in it due to which it’s not much preferrable nowadays as compared to balanced slope detector and phase-locked loop. Although all the components of this project were lost cost and easily accessible, however the transformer required wasn’t available in the market. So, we designed our own transformer of the required ratings.
